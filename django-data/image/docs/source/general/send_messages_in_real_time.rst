Send messages in real-time
==========================

Introduction to real time messaging
-----------------------------------

Channels is a project that takes Django and extends its abilities beyond HTTP - to handle WebSockets, chat protocols, IoT protocols, and more. Itâ€™s built on a Python specification called ASGI.
It does this by taking the core of Django and layering a fully asynchronous layer underneath, running Django itself in a synchronous mode but handling connections and sockets asynchronously, and giving you the choice to write in either style.


Sending messages in real-time using websocket protocol
------------------------------------------------------

Currently we use django-channels to send "Status" messages in real-time during data import, validation and submission.
Also we send messages to show notifications at the top of the "submission details" page during import, validation and submission phases.

Asgi image
__________

We run django channels in separate docker container (created from asgi image). All required code is stored in `submissions_ws`_ folder.
It has "routing" module to decide which consumer to use and "consumer" module that does all the required job.
