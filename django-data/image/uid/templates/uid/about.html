  <h1>About IMAGE-InjectTool</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      One key challenge of that <a href="http://www.imageh2020.eu/">IMAGE</a> addresses
      is the integration and transparent use of the vast information stored within
      more than 60 gene banks/genetic collections spanning 20 European countries,
      together with the collection of newly generated data. Information to be collected
      and integrated through the <a href="https://www.image2020genebank.eu/" target="_blank">
      IMAGE Data Portal</a> is currently stored in each
      individual's local databases at gene banks, research institutions, breeding
      companies etc. which utilizes a wide range of systems : from simple excel
      files to large national well-structured databases.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21364801/">Cryoweb</a>
      is a web-based software for the documentation and storage of gene bank data.
      Currently, the majority of National gene banks are using Cryoweb to manage
      their information. In France, the <a href="https://www.crb-anim.fr/">CRB-Anim</a>
      database collects and stores information for reproductive and genomic material
      of domestic animals including mammals, birds and fishes in the country.
      Other countries have developed relational databases to manage their collections.
      Using InjectTool, data derived from different sources can be standardized and
      validated against <a href="https://github.com/cnr-ibba/IMAGE-metadata">IMAGE metadata standards</a>
      and finally submitted to <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/">EBI BioSamples archive</a>,
      which has been chosen as the sample reference archive for all IMAGE data.
    </p>
    <p class="lead text-primary text-center">
      <strong>
        The IMAGE InjectTool is a tool which makes it easier to
        archive data into BioSamples from the user's point of view.
      </strong>

    <h2>Methods</h2>

    <p>
      The InjectTool has been developed to help gene bank managers to enhance, standardize, tag and submit
      their gene bank data to <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/">BioSamples archive</a> that integrates all
      gene bank records from across Europe. The InjectTool uses a well-defined
      <a href="https://github.com/cnr-ibba/IMAGE-metadata">metadata ruleset</a>
      ensuring high quality and comparable data across the diverse
      collections originating in different storage formats and languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      User will be able to import data from the dump files of either Cryoweb or CRB-Anim, or the template spreadsheet
      file into InjectTool and the system will validate and submit data to the BioSamples archive. User interaction is
      only required when the data fails the validation against <a href="https://github.com/cnr-ibba/IMAGE-metadata">
      IMAGE metadata standards</a> to make manual curations. Error messages are
      reported to the user within the user interface or by emails, and user is
      guided through the whole submission process by the system, which provides
      different functionalities accordingly to the submission stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      InjectTool can provide
      ontologies for <em>Countries</em>, <em>Species</em>, <em>Breeds</em>, <em>Physiological</em>
      and <em>developmental stages</em>,
      if possible. When unannotated terms are found during the data importation,
      annotation tasks will start in the background to look up for the most suitable
      ontology using <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/zooma/">EBI Zooma Tools</a>.
      InjectTool can also provide translation tables for <em>Species</em> terms, in order to refer
      to the correct species ontology by providing the common name in the user's own language
      during data loading. In such way, you can use the <em>Pig</em> term while
      defining your species: the system will translate it into <em>Sus scrofa</em>.
      A set of english word is defined for the most common species, however when
      InjectTool finds a new <em>Species</em> value it has not encountered before, it will stop
      the data import process and ask the user to manually input an appropriate ontology term.
      After that, all such word occurrences will be translated with the user provided species. If you have other terms
      that require translation tables, please <a href="mailto:{% get_admin_email %}?subject=feedback">contact us</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system is built on a set of customized <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> images using
      <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">docker-compose</a>:
      the user will interact on a webpage-based application powered by
      <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">Nginx</a>, while
      in the backend a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> instance
      stores data and a <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>
      image renders web pages using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 4</a>
      in order to display, validate, curate and submit data.
      <a href="http://www.celeryproject.org/">Celery</a> and <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> are used to perform
      time-consuming and monitoring tasks in the background such as the data validation process,
      data submissions to BioSamples archive and monitoring of
      BioSamples submission statuses.
      The project is mainly written in <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3</a>
      using the <a href="http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/">test-driven</a> approach. A live version of the system is available
      at <a href="{% url 'index' %}">{% absolute_url '/' %}</a> while
      the code is available at <a href="https://github.com/cnr-ibba/IMAGE-InjectTool">GitHub</a>.
      The BioSamples submission is done through the
      <a href="https://submission.ebi.ac.uk/api/docs/guide_overview.html">Data Submission Portal</a>
      using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyUSIrest/">pyUSIrest</a> python package.

      <p>
        InjectTool is currently in testing stage. We currently submit data to
        <a href="https://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/">BioSamples test server</a>, which synchronize the data with
        production server weekly. Therefore data submitted through InjectTool will be lost as planned.
        We are doing our best to shorten the test period
        while making the system as reliable as possible.
