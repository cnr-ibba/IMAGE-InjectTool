  <h1>About IMAGE-InjectTool</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      One key challenge of that <a href="http://www.imageh2020.eu/">IMAGE</a> addresses
      is the integration and transparent use of the vast information stored within
      more than 60 gene banks/genetic collections spanning 20 European countries,
      together with the collection of newly generated data. Information to be collected
      and integrated through the <a href="https://www.image2020genebank.eu/" target="_blank">
      IMAGE portal</a> is currently stored in each
      individual's local databases at gene banks, research institutions, breeding
      companies etc. which utilizes a wide range of systems : from simple excel
      files to large national well-structured databases.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21364801/">Cryoweb</a>
      is a web-based software for the documentation and storage of gene bank data.
      Currently, the majority of National gene banks are using Cryoweb to manage
      their information. In France, the <a href="https://www.crb-anim.fr/">CRB-Anim</a>
      database collects and stores information for reproductive and genomic material
      of domestic animals (mammals, birds, fishes and shellfishes) in the country.
      Other countries have developed relational databases to manage their collections.
      Using InjectTool, data derived from different sources can be standardized and
      validated against <a href="https://github.com/cnr-ibba/IMAGE-metadata">IMAGE metadata</a>
      standards and finally submitted to <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/">EBI BioSamples</a>,
      which has been chosen as the sample reference archive for all IMAGE data.
    </p>

      <strong>
        The IMAGE InjectTool is a tool which makes it easier to
        archive data into BioSamples from the user's point of view.

    <h2>Methods</h2>

    <p>
      The InjectTool has been developed to help gene bank/genomic collections
      managers to enhance, standardize, tag and submit their gene bank data to
      <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/">BioSamples archive</a> that integrates all
      gene bank records from across Europe. The InjectTool uses a well-defined
      metadata ruleset ensuring high quality and comparable data across the diverse
      collections originating in different storage formats and languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system is built on a set of customized <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> images using
      <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">docker-compose</a> :
      the user will interact on a web application rendered using
      <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">Nginx</a>, while
      on the backend a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> instance
      stores user data and a <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>
      image renders pages in HTML using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 4</a>
      in order to display data and proving forms able to do data manipulation.
      <a href="http://www.celeryproject.org/">Celery</a> and <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> are used to perform
      long tasks such as the data validation process, data submissions to BioSamples archive and monitoring of
      BioSamples submission statuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      User will be able to import data from the dump files of either Cryoweb or CRB-Anim, or the template spreadsheet
      file into InjectTool and Injects tool will validates and submits data to BioSamples archive. User interaction is
      only required when the data fails the validation against <a href="https://github.com/cnr-ibba/IMAGE-metadata">
      IMAGE metadata</a> standards to make manual curations.

      The project is mainly written in <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3</a>
      using the <a href="http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/">test-driven</a> approach. A live version of the system is available
      at <a href="{% url 'index' %}">{% absolute_url '/' %}</a> while
      the code is available <a href="https://github.com/cnr-ibba/IMAGE-InjectTool">here</a>

      <h2>InjectTool test site</h2>

      <p>
        InjectTool is currently in testing stage. We currently submit data to
        <a href="https://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/">BioSamples test server</a>, which synchronize the data with
        production server weekly. Therefore data submitted through InjectTool will be lost as planned.
        We are doing our best to shorten the test period
        while making the system as reliable as possible. We welcome any
        feedback/comment/suggestion which can be submitted by
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cnr-ibba/IMAGE-InjectTool/issues/new/choose">opening a new issue</a>
        to make InjectTool better.
