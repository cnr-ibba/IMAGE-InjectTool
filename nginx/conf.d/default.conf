# This conf file tells nginx to serve up media and static files from the filesystem,
# as well as handle requests that require Djangoâ€™s intervention. For a large deployment
# it is considered good practice to let one server handle static/media files, and
# another handle Django applications;

# the django component nginx needs to connect to

    # server unix:///path/to/your/image/image.sock; # for a file socket
    server uwsgi:8000; # for a web port socket (we'll use this first)
